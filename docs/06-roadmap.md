# 06 — Roadmap: next iteration

Written 2026-07-23, after the AI background layer (adr-009) and the editor
decomposition landed; updated 2026-07-24 when the manage-view and
client-routing iterations shipped and batch response counts (adr-012) were
taken as the next one. This doc plans the **next** iteration; when an item ships it moves
into [02-functional-requirements.md](02-functional-requirements.md) /
[03-non-functional-requirements.md](03-non-functional-requirements.md) with a
stable ID, per the docs conventions.

## Where we are

The MVP loop is complete end to end: one-sentence generate → per-field
edit/regenerate → publish (versioned snapshot, share link, OG image) → guest
RSVP → host dashboard. Free-tier-first routing (Groq/Gemini) with paid
fallbacks, BYOK for power users, operator-cost guardrails, durable metrics,
add-to-calendar, CSV export, optional AI backgrounds, single-container deploy
on a custom domain.

Three iterations have shipped since:

- **"Safe to open to real hosts"** — guardrails as FR-9 /
  [adr-008](decisions/adr-008-operator-cost-guardrails.md), durable metrics as
  FR-7, guest add-to-calendar as FR-4.5, plus FR-10 /
  [adr-009](decisions/adr-009-ai-background-layer.md) for backgrounds.
- **"The host can come back"** — below.
- **Client-side routing** — [adr-011](decisions/adr-011-client-router.md),
  below. Internal: no new requirement, no user-visible feature beyond one
  behaviour fix.

## Shipped: the host can come back

Goal was that publishing an invitation and checking its responses are two
separate visits, days apart, possibly on two different devices — and both
work. Settled in [ADR-010](decisions/adr-010-host-manage-link.md) (accepted)
and shipped as **FR-5.4–5.6**, refining FR-3.3 and FR-4.4.

What it fixed, against the three exposures that motivated it:

1. **The host dashboard was session-bound.** The manage token was written to
   `localStorage` at publish and never read back, and there was no host route
   at all — closing the tab made responses unreachable except by re-publishing,
   which orphaned the share link guests already had. Now `/manage/:id` resolves
   the token from the URL fragment, storage, or a pasted manage link (FR-5.4).
2. **The headcount could be wrong.** Counts summed every attending row, so a
   guest who answered no→yes was counted twice in the one number a host caters
   on. Re-submissions now collapse per guest at read time, with the replaced
   answer kept as history (FR-5.5).
3. **Response failures were invisible.** A stale-token `403` stopped the
   spinner and said nothing. Missing token, refused token, unknown invitation
   and network failure are now four distinct, recoverable states (FR-5.4).

Delivered as seven PRs — planning + status tokens, server counts, route and
token plumbing, the dashboard UI, the share-panel hierarchy, the landing
"your invitations" list, and this docs pass. Design preceded code: three
`templates/*` mockups in the E-invitation DS project (adr-010 §9).

Deliberately left out, with reasons in adr-010: RSVP deletion (§8), per-guest
edit tokens (§5), and the mockups' per-row response counts on the landing list
(one authenticated request per invitation on a static page — wants a batch
endpoint first).

## Shipped: client-side routing

React Router in `web/`, settled in
[ADR-011](decisions/adr-011-client-router.md) (accepted). An internal
iteration: no new requirement, and nothing user-visible except one behaviour
fix.

It was **groundwork, not a response to pressure** — the 2026-07-24 evaluation
declined a router and none of its revisit triggers had fired. Two things made
it the moment anyway: the manage view had left `useHostManage` doing raw
`history.replaceState` surgery to strip the `#t=` token, which is a router's
job done by hand; and at four routes the migration was as cheap as it would
ever be.

What landed:

1. **The route table moved** to `web/src/AppRoutes.tsx` on react-router-dom in
   declarative mode, with `main.tsx` reduced to the `BrowserRouter` entry
   point. Same four routes, same URLs.
2. **The id guard survived the regexes.** Those patterns doubled as the
   path-traversal check mirroring the server's `InvitationId`; a router's `:id`
   is permissive. `isInvitationId` now carries it, applied in the hooks that
   own the fetch rather than at the route boundary as planned — see the ADR's
   implementation notes.
3. **Three navigation points became transitions** — the editor back button, the
   landing calls to action, the invitations rows — dropping the `onStart` prop
   threaded through four buttons.
4. **The fragment token moved onto the router**, ending the split ownership of
   the history stack and, with it, a `localStorage` write and URL rewrite that
   were happening during render.
5. **A malformed id now says the link is dead** instead of rendering the
   marketing page. Not in the original plan: the parity PR preserved the old
   resolver's behaviour, correctly for a parity PR and wrongly on the merits.

Delivered as five PRs (plan, parity, transitions, not-found, fragment) plus
this docs pass. Cost: **+13.2 kB gzipped**, recorded under NFR-1.

Deliberately not done: data routers and loaders, nested layouts, route-level
code splitting. The ADR §1 keeps the declined evaluation's revisit triggers as
the conditions for widening that scope — nesting is the real one.

## Next iteration: batch response counts

Settled in [ADR-012](decisions/adr-012-batch-response-counts.md) (proposed),
to ship as **FR-5.7**, extending FR-5.6.

The returning-host list shipped as three-quarters of its mockup. The
`templates/landing-page` Returning variant gives each row a response count and
a "new since your last visit" marker; what
[YourInvitations.tsx](../web/src/components/YourInvitations.tsx) renders is a
monogram, a title and a relative publish time. adr-010's implementation notes
say why — the browser-local index holds no counts by design, and the only way
to get them was one token-authenticated request per invitation from the page
that has to be fastest — and closed with "revisit with a batch endpoint if
hosts ask."

**No host has asked.** It is being taken because it is the only backlog item
with nothing in front of it, and because closing the gap between a shipped
screen and the mockup it was built from is a better reason than adr-011's
groundwork turned out to be. Small, entirely inside the existing architecture,
no new dependency.

What makes it worth a decision record is not the endpoint but the shape:
`POST /api/invitations/counts` is the **first request in the app carrying more
than one capability token**, and the first place where a partial authorization
failure is a normal outcome rather than an error. So the ADR settles:

1. **POST, though it only reads** — a GET would put manage tokens in the query
   string, undoing the exact property adr-010 §2 chose the URL fragment for.
2. **Per-item authorization, `200` on partial success** — one stale token must
   never blank the other four rows.
3. **One counting implementation** — `summarizeRsvps` moves out of the route
   file so the row and the dashboard it links to cannot disagree.
4. **A 25-item cap**, which is also what bounds the multi-token oracle adr-010
   declined to rate-limit.
5. **The landing page never waits** — no spinner, no layout shift, failure is
   silence, and reading the list does not mark responses seen.

Four PRs (extract, endpoint, hook, rows) plus a docs pass. Out of scope: any
design work (the mockups already specify it), counts anywhere but the landing
list, and anything that would teach the server which invitations belong to one
host — that is the accounts model adr-005 rejected.

## Candidate backlog

- **RSVP deletion** — needs stable per-RSVP ids and a mutating token-gated
  endpoint; adr-010 §5's superseding covers the common case. Wait for a host
  to ask.
- **Notify the host on a new RSVP** — the honest version needs an email
  channel (and an address, which the accounts-free model doesn't collect).
  Revisit with any account-adjacent work.
- **Per-guest edit tokens** so a guest can amend their own answer instead of
  re-submitting — real infrastructure for a rare case (adr-010 §5).
- **SQLite (or similar) store** — only when multi-instance hosting or RSVP
  volume breaks the NFR-7 single-process assumption; interfaces are ready.
- **Per-key metering/credits** — stays rejected-for-now (adr-006); revisit
  only if the free-tier + rate-limit model proves too tight for real traffic.
- ~~**React Router in `web/`**~~ — shipped; see
  [adr-011](decisions/adr-011-client-router.md), which records the original
  declining evaluation, the fact that none of its revisit triggers had fired,
  and what widening the scope past declarative mode would take.
